Model Train Engines (FINAL / FROZEN)

This directory contains concrete implementations of ModelTrainEngine.

IMPORTANT:
- This is NOT a generic model layer.
- Files here define COMPLETE training semantics.
- No reusable model components are allowed.
- Do NOT import these engines outside training steps.
